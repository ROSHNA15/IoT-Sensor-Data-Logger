# IoT Sensor Data Logger using Python

## Project Overview
This project simulates an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network that logs real-time environmental data. It continuously generates random values for temperature, humidity, and voltage, timestamps them, and stores the readings in a CSV file for future analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- CSV file handling  
- Random data simulation  
- Datetime and automation concepts

## Features
- Simulates temperature, humidity, and voltage readings
- Stores all readings with timestamps
- Automatically creates and updates the data log file
- Easy to run and understand

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `iot_data_logger.py`
2. Run using: `python iot_data_logger.py`
3. Press Ctrl + C to stop data logging
4. Open `sensor_data.csv` to view the logged readings
